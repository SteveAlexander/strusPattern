* Pattern match stream processing of documents with Strus.

Licenced as MPLv2 (Mozilla Public License, Version 2 - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0)

StrusStream uses the high-performance multiple regex matching library "Hyperscan" by Intel 
(https://01.org/hyperscan) for extracting the basic tokens, the "terminals" of the pattern matching grammar.
Hyperscan is licensed under the BSD License (Copyright (c) 2015, Intel Corporation).

StrusStream allows you to define arbitrary complex patterns represented as tree with nodes of the form
find '[Hh][Ee][Ll][Ll][Oo]' and '[Ww][Oo][Rr][Ll][Dd]' within a range of 10 (tokens) in the same sentence.
It is able to process millions of such nodes on input documents at a time.
